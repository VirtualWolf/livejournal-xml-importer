Import posts and comments from LiveJournal XML files.

== Description ==

Simple importer to import entries and comments from LiveJournal XML files that have been generated with ljdump (https://github.com/ghewgill/ljdump). I found that the official LiveJournal Importer skipped a bunch of my posts for no apparent reason, so I hacked it to read XML instead.

== Installation ==

1. Go to Plugins -> Add New, click Upload Plugin.
2. Select the livejournal-xml-importer.zip file and click Install.
3. Go to the Tools -> Import screen, click on LiveJournal XML.
